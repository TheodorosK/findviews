# Ziggy, a R package to describe tuples

Ziggy is a data characterization engine. Give it a data frame, a selection of rows, and it answers the question *what make those rows special*? To do so it returns characteristic views, that is, visualizations that depict how the rows' distribution differ from that of the rest of the data.

Stay tuned for updates!
